> One rainy day 40 years ago, Moylan was headed to a meeting across Ford's campus and hopped in a company car. When he saw the fuel tank was nearly empty, he stopped at a gas pump. What happened next is something that's happened to all of us: He realized that he'd parked on the wrong side.

> Unlike the rest of us, he wasn't infuriated. He was inspired. By the time he pulled his car around, he was already thinking about how to solve this everyday inconvenience that drives people absolutely crazy. And because the gas pump wasn't covered by an overhead awning, he was also soaking wet. But when he got back to the office, Moylan didn't even bother taking off his drenched coat when he started typing the first draft of a memo.
> 
> "I would like to propose a small addition," he wrote, "in all passenger car and truck lines." The proposal he had in mind was a symbol on the dashboard that would tell drivers which side of the car the gas tank was on. [...]
> 
> As soon as they read his memo, they began prototyping his little indicator that would be known as the Moylan Arrow. Within months, it was on the dashboard of Ford's upcoming models. Within years, it was ripped off by the competition. Before long, it was a fixture of just about every car in the world.

> "Society loves the founder who builds new companies, like Henry Ford," Ford CEO Jim Farley told me. "I would argue that Jim Moylan is an equally compelling kind of disrupter: an engineer in a large company who insisted on making our daily lives better."
> These days, there are two types of drivers: the ones aware of the Moylan Arrow and the ones who get to find out.
