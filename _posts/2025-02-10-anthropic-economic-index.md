[Anthropic launched a report ](https://www.anthropic.com/news/the-anthropic-economic-index)about the impact of AI on the labor market. They will continue to gather usage data and make that public. 

The big takeaway of today’s usage is:
> Overall, we saw a slight lean towards augmentation, with 57% of tasks being augmented and 43% of tasks being automated. That is, in just over half of cases, AI was not being used to replace people doing tasks, but instead worked _with_ them, engaging in tasks like validation (e.g., double-checking the user’s work), learning (e.g., helping the user acquire new knowledge and skills), and task iteration (e.g., helping the user brainstorm or otherwise doing repeated, generative tasks).

This is how I currently use these systems. We will have to wait and see if this continues to be the case, as they become more powerful and affordable.
