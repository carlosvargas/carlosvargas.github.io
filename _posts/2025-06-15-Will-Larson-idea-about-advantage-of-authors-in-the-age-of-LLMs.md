title: Will Larson’s idea about advantage of authors in the age of LLMs

Will has an interesting idea about [how authors can still thrive in the age of LLMs](https://lethain.com/competitive-advantage-author-llms/). 

> Instead, I’ve been thinking about how this transition might go _right_ for authors. My favorite idea that I’ve come up with is the idea of written content as “datapacks” for thinking. Buy someone’s book / “datapack”, then upload it into your LLM, and you can immediately operate _almost_ as if you knew the book’s content.

This is a not necessarily a new idea. Kevin Rose has an article where he creates [custom ChatGPTs based on specific books ](https://www.kevinrose.com/p/creating-custom-gpts-from-world-class). 

What’s interesting about Will’s idea, is the _role_ of the author. Instead of having people upload your book to a chat bot (which most likely has already been illegally trained on), you provide a legal  way of doing that. 

> What is our competitive advantage as authors in a future where people are not _reading_ our work? Well, maybe they’re still _buying_ our work in the form of datapacks and such, but it certainly seems likely that book sales, like blog traffic, will be impacted negatively.
