> Do I program any faster? Not really. But it feels like I've gained 30% more time in my day because the machine is doing the work. I alternate between giving it instructions, reading a book, and reviewing the changes. If you would have told me even just six months ago that I'd prefer being an engineering lead to a virtual programmer intern over hitting the keys myself, I would not have believed it. I can go can make a coffee, and progress still happens. I can be at the playground with my youngest while work continues in the background. Even as I'm writing this blog post, Claude is doing some refactorings.
