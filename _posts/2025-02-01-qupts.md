title: "Link blog - Qupts"
linkblog: true

For a little over a year, I've been following [Simon Willison's](https://simonwillison.net/) excellent blog. One of the things that he does is post ["blogmarks"](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/22/link-blog/), which are very small posts with a title, URL, short snippet of commentary and a “via” link where appropriate.
This is similar to a social-media "quote" post, but with a little more space for his thoughts.

This is also a very easy/simple approach to start blogging. In his words:
> That’s the purpose of my link blog: it’s an ongoing log of things I’ve found—effectively a combination of public bookmarks and my own thoughts and commentary on why those things are interesting.

It also removes the huge overhead of doing an "proper" blogpost (which I will still try to do once in a while). 

## Why "Qupts"?
I decided to name my blogmarks, "Qupts", stealing this term from the [Quantum Thief books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Quantum_Thief). In these books, a qupt is a form of instantaneous, pervasive mental communication enabled by technology. And I thought it was a fun word to use to describe what I will try to do.
