This is clearly a dig at Attlassian. However, thanks to the comments, Gergely realizes that Attlassian is playing a different game:

> Looking closer, when going public in 2015, Atlassian turned a small profit for 2 years.

> Then it started to aggressively invest in growth (and making a loss)
> 
> The result? Revenues up 15x over 10 years. Valuation also up ~15x the same time as well.
> 
> Atlassian valued at $75B (!!) which is ~20x its current *revenue*. Thanks to the stable growth rate it shows to investors (I assume at least)

Just a quick reminder that things are not always what they seem (except for those times where they are lol).
