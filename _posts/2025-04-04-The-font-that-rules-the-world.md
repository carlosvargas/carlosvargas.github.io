Amazing [post by Marcin Wichary](https://aresluna.org/the-hardest-working-font-in-manhattan/) about a 135 year font “called” Gorton (he assumes that’s what it’s called because it doesn’t really have a proper name). 

Once you see it, you’ll realized how we use it everywhere. 

But what’s outstanding about this post, is the level of dedication Marcin has, to document the history of it. Hats off to you.
