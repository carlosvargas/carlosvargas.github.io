title: Quoting React is Insane

Mario has a great [blog post about the history](https://mbrizic.com/blog/react-is-insane/) of the web libraries and frameworks and how complex thing are right now. While it ends up focusing on how “not simple” React ended up being, it’s more a commentary of how building web apps is so challenging. 

> My answer to that question, surprisingly, stops roasting React and goes the opposite way, defending not only React, but also Angular and jQuery and everything that came before them. I think this code is bad because **making a interactive UI where any component can update any other component is simply one of the most complicated things you could do in software**.

> So, this entire rant about React... it's not even React's fault. Neither is Angular's, or jQuery's. Simply, whichever tech you choose will inevitably crumble down under the impossible complexity of building a reactive UI.


Great long read that brought back so many fond memories about jQuery and Angular 1. But not Angular 2, I will never forgive what they did to it.
