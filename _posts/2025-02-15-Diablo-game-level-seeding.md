Great read into [how a Diablo speedrunner player, got caught cheating](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/the-diablo-hackers-that-debunked-a-record-speedrun/), years after having the Guinness World Record. 

I also never though of how random level generation works. By using a timestamp as the seed, you can make sure that each run is unique. 

This quote in the comment killed me:
> So based on reading this, had his run been legitimate then there existed not only a “god seed” but a _specific point in time_ when the that run could be completed naturally.  
> Imagine buying a game and it came with a label:  
> “This game best completed on May 11th at 10am, 40 years after publishing.”
